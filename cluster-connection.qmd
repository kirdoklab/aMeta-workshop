title: "How to connect to servers?"

--- 

## How will we work?

In this workshop, we will use our computers, and we will connect to high performance computing systems. Therefore, you will need to bring your laptops with you. 

You should be comfortable using the Unix/Linux command line to take this course. We know that there will be several operating systems. So please check these recomendations based on your operating system.

### Linux systems

If you have a Linux system (e.g. Ubuntu), you do not need to worry a lot. Most of the command line tools (like `ssh`) will be already installed on your system.

### Mac systems

Mac systems also have a default support on the command line. The `terminal` application on your Mac system is enough. But you can also install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as a `terminal` replacement for your Mac.

### Windows systems

If you have a Windows system, the easiest choice to connect a remote server is [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) tool.

## High performance computers

In this workshop, we have two different cluster systems at our disposal. The first system TRUBA (Turkish National Scientific Cluster) is funded by the TUBİTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye). The second system is located at Middle East Technical University.

### TRUBA Cluster system

This cluster system accepts connections from University networks only. Therefore, you should be in a University network in order to access TRUBA computers. We will provide a username and a password for your connection.

You can connect to TRUBA by writing this command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh egitim@levrek1.ulakbim.gov.tr

```

There is a trick to connect TRUBA system outside of the university network described at the end of this document.

### Middle East Technical University computing systems

This computer system is located at Middle East Technical University. It consists of two clusters: `baggins` and `NEOGENE`.

Since the NEOGENE cluster does not accept connections from outside the university networks, we will first connect to `baggins` via `ssh`. Then we can connect to `NEOGENE` from within this system.

Your username and password will be provided on the first day of the workshop.

Connect to the `baggins` server with your `username` like this:

```bash
ssh -p 2275 username@144.122.38.49

```

Afterwards, you can connect to `NEOGENE` from withing `baggins` this way:

```bash
ssh username@144.122.38.50
```

### Connecting to the TRUBA system from outside the university network

We can connect to the TRUBA system from outside the university network with a small trick. First, we will connect to the `baggins` cluster as described above, so we will be on the Middle East Technical University network. Then we can connect to TRUBA from that terminal.

```bash

ssh -p 2275 username@144.122.38.49

ssh egitim@levrek1.ulakbim.gov.tr

```

## Configuration

All the tools are installed on these server systems. Before using the tools, we need to set the `PATH` variable and show the system where these tools are installed.

### Configuration of the TRUBA system

To use all the tools for aMeta, please set your `PATH` variable like this:

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/truba/home/egitim/miniconda3/envs/aMeta/bin/

```

### Configuration on the Ankara computers

To use all the tools for aMeta, please set your `PATH` variable like this:

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/sw/anaconda3/envs/aMeta/

```

The workshop folder on the Ankara computer will be here:

```
cd /mnt/NEOGENE4/projects/microbe_2023/
```
