## How we will work?

In this workshop, we will use our computers, and we will connect to high performance computing systems. Therefore, you will need to bring your laptops with you. 

You should have been comfortable using the Unix/Linux command line to take the course. We know that there will be several operating systems. So please check these reccomendations based on your operating system.

### Linux systems

If you have a Linux system (e.g. Ubuntu), you do not need to worry a lot. Most of the command line tools (like `ssh`) will be already installed on your system

### Mac systems

Mac systems also have a default support on command line. The `terminal` application on your mac system would be enough. But we advise you to install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as a `terminal` replacement for your Mac.

### Windows systems

If you have a Windows system, the easiest chioice to connect a remote server is [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) tool.

## Cluster systems

In this workshop, we have two different cluster systems at our disposal. The first system TRUBA (Turkish National Scientific Cluster) that is funded by the TUBİTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye). The second system is located at Middle East Technical University.

### TRUBA Cluster system

This cluster system accept connections from University networks. Therefore you should be in a University network in order to access TRUBA computers. We will provide a username and a password for your connection.

Then, you can connect to this system like this:

```bash
ssh egitim@levrek1.ulakbim.gov.tr

```

There is a trick to connect TRUBA system outside of university network. We will describe it in the document.

### Middle East Technical University computing systems

This computer system is located at Middle East Technical University. It consists of two clusters: `baggins` and `NEOGENE`. We will work mostly on `baggings` to explain tools. At the end, we plan to send snakemake jobs on the NEOGENE system.

However, NEOGENE system does not accept conections outside from university networks but `baggins` can. So we will first connect to `baggins` via `ssh` first. Then we can connect to `NEOGENE` from this system.

Your username and password will be provided on the first day of the workshop.

Connect to `baggins` server with your `username` like this:

```bash
ssh -p 2275 username@144.122.38.49

```

Afterwards, you can connect to `NEOGENE` like this:

```bash
ssh username@144.122.38.50
```

### Connecting to TRUBA system outside of universiy network

We can connect to TRUBA system with a small trick. First we will connect to Baggins cluster, so we will be on the Middle East Technical Univerisy network. Then we can connect to TRUBA.

```bash

ssh -p 2275 username@144.122.38.49

ssh egitim@levrek1.ulakbim.gov.tr

```

## Configuration

All the tools are installed on these server systems. Before using the tools, we need to set the `PATH` variable and show the system where these tools are installed.

### Configuration on the TRUBA system

To use all the tools for aMeta, please set your `PATH` variable like this:

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/truba/home/egitim/miniconda3/envs/aMeta/bin/

```

### Configuration on the Ankara computers

To use all the tools for aMeta, please set your `PATH` variable like this:

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/sw/anaconda3/envs/aMeta/

```
