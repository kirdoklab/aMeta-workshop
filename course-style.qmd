title: "How to follow the Course?"

---

In this course, we would like to show you the mechanics of the aMeta workflow by creating a step-by-step tutorial.

The aim is to give information on the every snakemake rule, and let you run it manually.

The tutorial part of the course is designed on a specific system. So, if you want to follow this tutorial in your server system, you need to install the tools by yourself using conda or any other package manager.

We will first show you the snakemake rule. For example, this code in the quality control part:

```

rule FastQC_BeforeTrimming:
    """Run fastq before trimming"""
    output:
        html="results/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}_fastqc.html",
        zip="results/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}_fastqc.zip",
    input:
        fastq=lambda wildcards: samples.loc[wildcards.sample].fastq,
    conda:
        "../envs/fastqc.yaml"
    envmodules:
        *config["envmodules"]["fastqc"],
    benchmark:
        "benchmarks/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}.benchmark.txt"
    message:
        "FastQC_BeforeTrimming: RUNNING QUALITY CONTROL WITH FASTQC FOR SAMPLE {input.fastq} BEFORE TRIMMING ADAPTERS"
    log:
        "logs/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}.log",
    threads: 2
    shell:
        "fastqc {input.fastq} --threads {threads} --nogroup --outdir results/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING &> {log}"
```

There are specific snakemake commands in here. To improve the readability, we will delete some of the content in each rule.

Here, we would like to first explain the parameters in each rule:

## Using conda package manager

Each rule can contain a conda environment. So, if you will run snakemake with `--use-conda` flag, the specified environment will be installed given you have the conda package manager already installed:

```
    conda:
        "../envs/fastqc.yaml"
```

## Using environment modules

If you want to use the environmental modules, then you need to use `envmodules` flag with the snakemake. In this case, you would like to modify the envirÄ±nmental module file.

```
 envmodules:
        *config["envmodules"]["fastqc"]

```

## Benchmarks

You could find benchmarking stats with under the `benchmarking` folder.

```
    benchmark:
        "benchmarks/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}.benchmark.txt"

```

## Logs

If you have problems with your snakemake run, each rule will have a log file. So you can check the errors:

```
    log:
        "logs/FASTQC_BEFORE_TRIMMING/{sample}.log",
```
