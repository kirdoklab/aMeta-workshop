## Course setup

Once you have connected to the TRUBA server with your **own username**, you can begin to setup your folder for the course.

Create the necessary folders:

```bash
mkdir -p workshop/data
mkdir -p workshop/logs/slurm
mkdir -p workshop/scripts
mkdir -p workshop/resources
```
Create links to the files you will use:

```bash
# Create links for the FastQ files
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/data/* workshop/data
# Create links for the bash scripts 
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/*.sh workshop
# Create links for the R and python scripts 
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/scripts/* workshop/scripts
# Create links for the necessary resources files
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/resources/* workshop/resources
```

Great, you have now created your workshop folder. From now on, you will be working in this folder. Please enter your directory now using this command:

```bash
cd workshop
```

You can follow the pipeline step by step. Good luck !
