## Course setup

Once you have connected to the TRUBA server with your own username, you can begin to setup your folder for the course.

Create the necessary folders:

```bash
mkdir -p workshop/data
mkdir -p workshop/logs/slurm
```
Create links to the files you will use:

```bash
# Create links for the FastQ files
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/data/* workshop/data
# Create links for the scripts 
ln -s /truba/home/egitim/workshop/*.sh workshop
```

Then you can follow step after step the pipeline. Good luck !
