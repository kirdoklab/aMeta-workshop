title: "aMeta Workshop in Mersin"
date: "6th to 10th February 2023"

Welcome to the workshop on **aMeta: an accurate and memory-efficient ancient Metagenomic profiling workflow** that will be held at Mersin University, Department of Biotechnology within the scope of the European Union funded [NEOMATRIX](https://neomatrix.metu.edu.tr/) collaboration project.

In this web page, we aim to publish the tutorial material of the aMeta ancient metagenomic profiling workflow.

**aMeta** [Pochon & Bergfeldt et al., 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510579v1.abstract) is designed to analyse the metagenomic content of ancient samples from a wide variety of host organisms (including humans) or from environmental samples.

Please find the GitHub repository of the pipeline [here](https://github.com/NBISweden/aMeta).

The tutorial part of the course is designed for a specific system. So, if you want to follow this tutorial on your own, you have to install the tools by yourself either as environmental modules or by creating a conda environment as described in the [official aMeta GitHub](https://github.com/NBISweden/aMeta), and activate this environment before performing the different commands.
